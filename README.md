# üèîÔ∏è Himalayan Expeditions ‚Äì SQL Data Analysis Project

A storytelling-driven SQL analysis project exploring the motivations, challenges, and outcomes of Himalayan mountain climbers. Inspired by the human side of data, the project answers key questions about why people climb, what happens during expeditions, and what follows after.



## Tools Used
- SQL (SQLite)
- DB Browser for SQLite
- Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn for optional visualizations)
- GitHub for publishing and version control



## Project Objectives

To analyze and uncover patterns from a multi-table Himalayan expedition dataset by answering:
1. **Why do people climb?**
2. **What happens during the climb?**
3. **What happens after the climb?**

This is achieved through:
- 23 SQL queries across different focus areas
- Deep dive into six key data slices
- Insights written in clear business language

## Sample Insights

- **Disabled climbers** shared common nationalities and climbed specific peaks, reflecting a strong theme of resilience.
- **Climb outcomes varied by gender, occupation, and nationality**, revealing both disparities and unexpected patterns.
- **Deaths by nationality** showed concentration among a few countries ‚Äî raising questions about experience, route selection, and expedition support.
- **Success rates** were higher for professions requiring discipline and training (military, engineers, doctors), and lower for first-timers and students.

##  What Makes This Project Unique

- Focused on **human stories** through SQL ‚Äî not just technical metrics  
- Organized into clean, explainable folders  
- Ready to be extended with Python-based visualizations



##  Status

Queries, insights, structure complete  
Visuals pending (to be added gradually)
