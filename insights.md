### Why Climb?
— A Look into Disabled Climbers’ Commonalities

This table focuses on 116 climbers who undertook Himalayan expeditions despite physical disabilities. What emerges is not just a dataset but a deeply human portrait of resilience, motivation, and identity.

Key observations:
Nationality: A large number of climbers are from the USA and UK, with a few from countries like Singapore, India, and others. This may reflect better access to support systems, funding, and adaptive sports infrastructure in developed nations.

Popular Peaks: Everest stands out as the most attempted mountain — a symbolic and literal summit that likely holds greater meaning for climbers seeking to challenge societal and physical limitations.

Occupations: Many individuals were public speakers, media professionals, or associated with adventure travel businesses. This suggests that personal narratives and professional lives often overlap in the disabled climbing community — these are not just climbers but storytellers and advocates.

Gender: The dataset appears overwhelmingly male-dominated, highlighting a potential gender gap in disabled expedition participation even though the list is dominated by climbers from much socially and economically advanced nations. 

Interpretation:
This table isn't just a count of climbs — it reflects the psychology of those who climb despite. Everest and other peaks act as metaphors for inner strength and societal defiance. The clustering of certain occupations and nationalities suggests that while the body might be limited, the narrative power of their journeys often finds a platform — in speeches, books, or enterprises that empower others.


### What Happens During the Climb?
— Success Patterns by Gender:

This table provides a gender-wise breakdown of Himalayan expedition outcomes, highlighting success rates, solo attempts, and even controversial claims. It's a compact yet revealing view into the gender dynamics of high-altitude climbing.

Key Observations:

-Male Climbers (M) dominate Himalayan expeditions with 80,190 total climbers, out of which 33,696 had successful climbs. There were 126 solo attempts, with 84 claimed successes and 114 disputes, suggesting that while solo success is often celebrated, it's also frequently questioned.

-Female Climbers (F) total 8,809, with a success count of 3,233 and only 7 solo climbs. Interestingly, 7 climbs were claimed successes, and 16 were disputed — a higher dispute ratio per claimed success compared to men. This may reflect bias or greater scrutiny female climbers face in proving summit claims.

Interpretation:
This dataset mirrors real-world inequalities: climbing remains a male-dominated pursuit, but female climbers still exhibit notable success rates. The higher rate of disputed claims among women is telling — either of the skepticism they face or the stringent standards applied to validate their achievements. Meanwhile, the low numbers of solo climbs among women may reflect access, risk culture, or historical barriers rather than capability.

In short, this table is less about physical summits and more about social ones — who gets to climb, and who gets believed when they say they did.
