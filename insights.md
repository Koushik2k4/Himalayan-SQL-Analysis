### Why Climb?


## A Look into Disabled Climbers’ Commonalities:

This table focuses on 116 climbers who undertook Himalayan expeditions despite physical disabilities. What emerges is not just a dataset but a deeply human portrait of resilience, motivation, and identity.

Key observations:
Nationality: A large number of climbers are from the USA and UK, with a few from countries like Singapore, India, and others. This may reflect better access to support systems, funding, and adaptive sports infrastructure in developed nations.

Popular Peaks: Everest stands out as the most attempted mountain — a symbolic and literal summit that likely holds greater meaning for climbers seeking to challenge societal and physical limitations.

Occupations: Many individuals were public speakers, media professionals, or associated with adventure travel businesses. This suggests that personal narratives and professional lives often overlap in the disabled climbing community — these are not just climbers but storytellers and advocates.

Gender: The dataset appears overwhelmingly male-dominated, highlighting a potential gender gap in disabled expedition participation even though the list is dominated by climbers from much socially and economically advanced nations. 

Interpretation:
This table isn't just a count of climbs — it reflects the psychology of those who climb despite. Everest and other peaks act as metaphors for inner strength and societal defiance. The clustering of certain occupations and nationalities suggests that while the body might be limited, the narrative power of their journeys often finds a platform — in speeches, books, or enterprises that empower others.


### What Happens During the Climb?

## Success Patterns by Gender:

This table provides a gender-wise breakdown of Himalayan expedition outcomes, highlighting success rates, solo attempts, and even controversial claims. It's a compact yet revealing view into the gender dynamics of high-altitude climbing.

Key Observations:

-Male Climbers (M) dominate Himalayan expeditions with 80,190 total climbers, out of which 33,696 had successful climbs. There were 126 solo attempts, with 84 claimed successes and 114 disputes, suggesting that while solo success is often celebrated, it's also frequently questioned.

-Female Climbers (F) total 8,809, with a success count of 3,233 and only 7 solo climbs. Interestingly, 7 climbs were claimed successes, and 16 were disputed — a higher dispute ratio per claimed success compared to men. This may reflect bias or greater scrutiny female climbers face in proving summit claims.

Interpretation:
This dataset mirrors real-world inequalities: climbing remains a male-dominated pursuit, but female climbers still exhibit notable success rates. The higher rate of disputed claims among women is telling — either of the skepticism they face or the stringent standards applied to validate their achievements. Meanwhile, the low numbers of solo climbs among women may reflect access, risk culture, or historical barriers rather than capability.

In short, this table is less about physical summits and more about social ones — who gets to climb, and who gets believed when they say they did.



## Success by Peak:

This table displays the number of successful summits and total attempts for each Himalayan peak, allowing us to compute and compare the success rate across peaks. It serves as a lens into which peaks are frequently climbed, how often climbers succeed, and which mountains pose greater challenges.

Key Observations:

-High success rates were seen on peaks like Cho Oyu, Island Peak, Lobuche East, and Mera Peak, all of which had success rates well above 70%.

-Extremely low success rates (below 40%) were recorded on major 8000ers such as Annapurna I, Makalu, Kangchenjunga, and Dhaulagiri.

-Mount Everest had a moderate success rate (~55–60%) despite having one of the highest attempt counts, which stands out as a balance between popularity and risk.

-Some mid-tier peaks with fewer expeditions still had notably low success rates, suggesting technical difficulty or less infrastructure support.

Interpretation:

-The success rate is a strong proxy for the difficulty and risk level associated with each peak. Trekking peaks like Island Peak and Lobuche East are frequently used for training or commercial expeditions, and their high success rates reflect better preparation, infrastructure, and lower technical demand.

-On the other hand, 8000-meter giants like Annapurna I or Kangchenjunga consistently record lower success rates, which correlates with their technical routes, higher fatality risk, and unpredictable weather. These are mountains where experience, strategy, and luck matter more than numbers.

-The data also reflects how Everest stands as a unique case: heavily climbed, moderately dangerous, and well-supported — making it both attainable and formidable depending on the climber’s approach.



## Success by Nationality:

This table presents a breakdown of summit attempts and successes categorized by nationality, enabling us to assess which countries have a higher success rate in Himalayan expeditions. It's a powerful lens into the experience, preparation, and climbing culture of different nations.

Key Observations:

-Climbers from Japan, South Korea, the USA, and the UK recorded very high numbers of expeditions — reflecting long-standing mountaineering cultures and substantial logistical support.

-Countries like Switzerland, Austria, and France exhibited high success rates despite fewer total attempts, which points to a tradition of technical excellence and alpine discipline.

-Indian and Chinese climbers had a relatively high number of attempts but lower success rates, which could stem from more first-time climbers, budget expeditions, or less experience on technical climbs.

-Nepalese climbers, although often employed as guides and support staff, showed a balanced mix of high attempts and a solid success rate, indicating deep local knowledge of the terrain.

Interpretation:

Success rates by nationality offer more than just statistics — they reveal how cultural, economic, and geographical factors influence expedition outcomes.
Countries with rich mountaineering heritages like Switzerland or Japan often combine skill, training, and selective ambition, resulting in higher success. On the other hand, nations with rising interest in mountaineering — including India and China — may see large numbers but with more variability in preparedness, especially on tough routes.
It also speaks to institutional support: countries with structured climbing federations, subsidized training, and established expedition companies naturally see better performance in extreme conditions.

## success by occupation:

This analysis explores the relationship between a climber's occupation and their expedition success, revealing how professional background might influence high-altitude outcomes.

key observations:

-Doctors, engineers, military personnel, and full-time climbers tend to show higher success rates, possibly due to better physical conditioning, planning, or risk management skills.

-Students and photographers had noticeably lower success rates, suggesting a potential gap in preparedness or experience.

-Several less common professions — such as priests, writers, and artists — appeared rarely and had inconsistent outcomes.

Interpretation-
Occupational background seems to reflect not just physical ability, but also the mental preparedness and structure that climbers bring with them. Professions that demand high responsibility, endurance, or strategic planning tend to translate better into successful expeditions.

## Deaths by Nationality

This table aggregates expedition deaths based on the climbers' nationality. It offers a unique lens into how different countries fare in terms of risk outcomes and potentially how prepared or experienced their expeditions tend to be.

Key observations:

-A few countries dominate the death count, likely due to higher participation rates. For example, countries like the USA, Japan, UK, and South Korea frequently appear at the top.

-However, when normalized by the number of climbers per country (not shown here but can be inferred), some nations show disproportionately higher death rates — suggesting potential gaps in training, equipment, or experience.

-Countries with alpine traditions (e.g., Switzerland, France) tend to have fewer deaths despite relatively active participation, possibly reflecting better mountaineering infrastructure or institutional knowledge.

-Developing nations show lower absolute numbers, but this is likely due to lower representation in high-risk expeditions.

Interpretation:
This insight can inform policymakers, mountaineering federations, and training institutions. By understanding which national groups face higher risks, targeted interventions (like mandatory prep programs or safety workshops) can be designed. Additionally, this table connects back to the broader narrative of “What happens after the climb?” — not all climbers return home, and this data humanizes that loss on a national scale.
