### Why Climb? — A Look into Disabled Climbers’ Commonalities

This table focuses on 116 climbers who undertook Himalayan expeditions despite physical disabilities. What emerges is not just a dataset but a deeply human portrait of resilience, motivation, and identity.

Key observations:
Nationality: A large number of climbers are from the USA and UK, with a few from countries like Singapore, India, and others. This may reflect better access to support systems, funding, and adaptive sports infrastructure in developed nations.

Popular Peaks: Everest stands out as the most attempted mountain — a symbolic and literal summit that likely holds greater meaning for climbers seeking to challenge societal and physical limitations.

Occupations: Many individuals were public speakers, media professionals, or associated with adventure travel businesses. This suggests that personal narratives and professional lives often overlap in the disabled climbing community — these are not just climbers but storytellers and advocates.

Gender: The dataset appears overwhelmingly male-dominated, highlighting a potential gender gap in disabled expedition participation even though the list is dominated by climbers from much socially and economically advanced nations. 

Interpretation:
This table isn't just a count of climbs — it reflects the psychology of those who climb despite. Everest and other peaks act as metaphors for inner strength and societal defiance. The clustering of certain occupations and nationalities suggests that while the body might be limited, the narrative power of their journeys often finds a platform — in speeches, books, or enterprises that empower others.
